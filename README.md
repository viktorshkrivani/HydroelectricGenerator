# ⚡ Project D – Hydroelectric Generator  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates the design, construction, and testing of a **hydroelectric generator** built to power a lightbulb using flowing water as the energy source.  
Inspired by **my dad’s work at a hydroelectric plant** and motivated by the design of the **Francis turbine**, our project replicates how real-world systems convert kinetic energy from water into usable electricity.  

By recreating this principle on a smaller scale, we explored how turbines spin magnets past coils to generate voltage, applying the concepts of **Faraday’s Law of Induction** and **electromagnetic theory**.  

## ⚙️ Design & Procedure  
- **Turbine**: A Francis-style water turbine to rotate the shaft.  
- **Generator core**:  
  - A central shaft with **3 bar magnets**.  
  - Stationary housing with **3 copper wire coils (200 turns each)**.  
- **Process**:  
  - Water strikes the turbine, spinning the shaft.  
  - Magnets rotate past the coils, changing magnetic flux.  
  - This induces an electric current, demonstrating how hydro plants generate power.

These documents contain the mathematical details, diagrams, and step-by-step reasoning behind our 

## 📐 Theoretical Basis  
- **Faraday’s Law of Induction** → explains how changing magnetic flux induces EMF (voltage).  
- **Magnetic Flux concepts** → helped us approximate how much voltage we should see.  
- **Electromagnetism principles** → guided coil design, turns of wire, and magnet placement.  

We didn’t just rely on intuition — calculations based on these laws allowed us to **predict the voltage output** and then test it against our experimental results.  


## 🔬 Experimental Testing  
- Generator tested with an electric drill at **450 rpm (7.5 rps)**.  
- Predicted voltage vs. measured voltage differed by only about **8%**, showing strong agreement between theory and experiment.  
- This proved that even a simple, small-scale setup could accurately demonstrate the physics of large hydroelectric plants.  


## ⚠️ Sources of Error  
- Resistive losses in coil-to-coil connections.  
- Measurement difficulties with magnetic field sensors.  
- Assumption that magnetic field always dropped to zero (not fully accurate with closely spaced magnets).  


## 🏆 What I Learned  
- How **theory translates into practice**: using Faraday’s law not only in equations, but in real design decisions.  
- The importance of **efficiency considerations** — small changes in design (coil turns, magnet spacing, turbine shape) create big differences in output.  
- **Teamwork & troubleshooting**: identifying measurement errors and design flaws together was key.  
- Personal motivation: building this project deepened my appreciation for hydroelectric plants — especially since I grew up hearing about my dad’s work in the industry.  


## 🚀 Reflection  
This project was more than just building a small generator — it was about **understanding the physics that power entire cities**.  
By connecting real-world hydroelectric systems to a hands-on model, I gained both technical knowledge and personal inspiration to keep pursuing energy and sustainability challenges in engineering.
